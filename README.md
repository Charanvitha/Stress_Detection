# Stress_Detection


Stress Detection Readme
Stress Detection in Google Colab
Overview
This project focuses on detecting stress using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes physiological, behavioral, or textual data to determine stress levels in individuals. The implementation is carried out in Google Colab, leveraging its cloud-based resources for efficient processing.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares input data.

Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant stress indicators (e.g., heart rate, text sentiment, facial expressions, etc.).

Model Training: Uses machine learning models like SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs.

Real-time Detection: Predicts stress levels from live or recorded input.

Visualization: Displays stress trends using charts and graphs.

Requirements
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras nltk opencv-python mediapipe
Dataset
Public datasets like WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) or DASPS (Driver Stress Prediction) can be used.

Custom datasets can be created using sensor data, text logs, or facial emotion analysis.

Usage
Clone the repository (if applicable) or upload files to Google Colab.

Load dataset: Use pandas or numpy to read data.

Preprocess data: Handle missing values, normalize inputs, and extract features.

Train the model: Use pre-trained models or train from scratch.

Make predictions: Test the model on unseen data.

Visualize results: Plot graphs to analyze trends.

Example Code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("stress_data.csv")
X = data.drop("stress_level", axis=1)
y = data["stress_level"]

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
Applications
